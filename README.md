# A spot for Data Structures & Algorithms fun

### Credit due to:

- **LeetCode** for providing a great resource for practice
  - and some elegant and optimal solutions that I have worked to internalize the intution behind
- **Jay Wengrow** for his amazing book [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures & Algorithms](https://pragprog.com/titles/jwdsal2/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition/)
  - this is the book that helped DS&A (and especially Big O) really click for me
